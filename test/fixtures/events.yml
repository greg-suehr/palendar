Join us as we kick off a new series of films here at the Harris. PRINT IT! will cover the history of newsrooms and newspaper reporters featured on film!

  title: Step Afrika!
  description: Step Afrika!’s signature work The Migration - Reflections on Jacob Lawrence charts the story of African Americans moving from the rural South to the industrial North to escape Jim Crow, racial oppression, and lynchings in the early 1900s.

roxanne:
  title: Roxanne (1987) with Valentine's Day chocolate!
  description: Comic genius Steve Martin delivers an incredible performance as a hero who has only one tiny flaw—no, one huge flaw, his astonishingly long nose. The laughter never stops in this latter-day spin on Cyrano de Bergerac as Martin’s small-town fire chief deals with jerky nose jokes, a bumbling crew of firemen, and his secret love for gorgeous astronomy student Roxanne (Daryl Hannah), who unfortunately is attracted to a fireman long on looks and short on conversation. All the while he’s encouraged to make his feelings known by his friend Dixie (Shelley Duvall). A contemporary love story of mistaken identity and unrequited love, Roxanne is an unforgettable charmer that Siskel & Ebert call a comic masterpiece.
